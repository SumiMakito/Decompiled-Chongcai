# Decompiled Chongcai

This repository keeps a copy of the decompiled applications developed by the SO-CALLED company "ChongCai", which "founded" by a group of childish guys.

A founder of Chongcai said they developed these applications on their own. 

But looking at the package name, we can easily infer that they have used an automatic tool to generate those applications. 

Yeah, I'm serious. It is GENERATING, not DEVELOPING.

For educational purposes only. #(滑稽)
